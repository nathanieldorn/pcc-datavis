# A Basic Data Visualization Project with Matplotlib and Plotly
Inspired by the data visualization projects in Python Crash Course, 3rd edition.

To create visuals, remove comments from the desired function calls in main.py. Only one may be run at a time.

## Squares
Create either a line or dot plot of the square of numbers. 
### Line Plot (squared_num_line)
The array, input_values, contains the integers, one through eight, to be squared and plotted. The function call will only display the result.
### Dot Plot (squared_num_points)
The array, x_values, represents the integers to be squared and is created using a list comprehension. It's counterpart list, y_values, uses list comprehension to calculate the square. The function call will both display and save a file of the result.

## Random Walks
